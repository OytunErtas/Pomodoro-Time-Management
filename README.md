# Pomodoro-Time-Management
This program helps users efficiently implement the Pomodoro technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method designed to improve focus and productivity. It involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros," followed by a short 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. This cycle helps prevent burnout, maintain concentration, and enhance task management.
